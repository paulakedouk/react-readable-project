# Readable: A Content and Comment Web App

Leverage the strengths of Redux to build a "Readable" application where
users can post text content and comment on each other's posts. This app was built from scratch while combining the state management
features of Redux with the declarative component model from React. When
complete, users can submit your posts, comment on existing posts,
and edit and delete posts and comments.
